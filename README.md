## Project archived and not maintained anymore

This project was active for some time, but my professional focus has since shifted. 

A few key factors have led to my decision to archive it:
- Scala's niche status: Sadly, Scala has become a niche programming language. Although I am still very fond of it, I must acknowledge the reality of its current adoption.
- Shift to Rust: My open-source contributions are now primarily focused on Rust, which offers the freedom to develop outside of the JVM ecosystem.
- Official Slack SDK: An official Java SDK for Slack is now available, fulfilling one of the needs this project originally aimed to address.

For these reasons, the project will now be archived. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
