## Project archived and not maintained anymore
The project was in use and active sometkmes while I was working mostly with JVM for a while.
A few things happened:
- Scala became a really niche programming language sadly. While I still like it very much but I see the reality.
- I focused on Rust development more recently for OSS that gives the fredrom to work without JVM.
- There is Java official SDK for Slack now.

These are main reasons to archive thus project. Feel free to reach out if you have a question or anything else.
